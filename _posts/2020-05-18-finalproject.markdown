<p>This is my Bachelor's Degree Final Project, which proposes a human-robot-interaction system. I used Microsoft Face API to realize facial recognition, while designed robot's behavior by the NAO choregraphe suite. The system was finally experimented on Pepper robot.</p>
<p>Thanks professors and friends from TUAT. I appreciate the time they spent helping me with the project and helping me accommodate myself to the new life in Tokyo.</p>
<p>Of course, I would like to give special thanks to my supervisor Marie! Thank you for providing the opportunity for me :)</p>
